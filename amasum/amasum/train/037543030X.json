Up until now he’s been taking special education classes at the local public school, but with the virus, he will be homeschooled from now on. I wasn’t sure where to start and this book has been great. It’s helped a lot with his reading, helping him to understand and hear the sounds. I’m not sure he will ever read well, but these workbooks will be an asset in helping to read at least some. My goal is to get him reading at least on a second grade level. These books will aid greatly reaching that goal."

In fact, had to send back a couple others and re-order these for everyone because they are so complete, so engaging and colorful. Lots of games to make it fun. The only thing I'm not sure about is that the directions for the exercises are really written in big words. If a kid can't figure out the exercise on their own, they need adult help to explain the point."
