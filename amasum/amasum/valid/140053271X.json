It worked for about 4 years this time, but the screen suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. I don’t use it every day and store it properly, so there’s no reason it should stop working. Disappointed in the tech problems and I would recommend buying a different model."

I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.
