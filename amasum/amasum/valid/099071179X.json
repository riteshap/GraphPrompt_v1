Author also recommends giving people bad deals and over-charging on rent so you can \"live for free\" - highly unethical in my opinion. The constant and obvious plugging of the webite and podcast also felt patronizing...we get the message the first time, was it really necessary to keep recommending it on every fourth page? Certainly some good information in there, however all the other stuff made it a tiresome read."

Since then I've emailed them multiple times for an answer even including my order number without so much as a reply back. The audiobook isn't expensive but the fact that it's offered for free at the start of the ebook and there is no way to get it is ridiculous. If the offer is no longer available I'd expect them to update the ebook. Very disappointed in BiggerPockets over this"

Yes, the principles are the same, but I feel Turner has better cautionary notes and advice. There's a chapter on buying in an expensive area, which is particularly necessary for where I live."

Seriously, I left the book in my living room and every time I picked it up, it was hard to put down. Brandon speaks from extensive experience and shares a ton of lessons learned. He leans more toward using debt to accelerate growth, something I don’t personally have the appetite for, but whether you are looking to invest in real estate debt free or not, the book is valuable and well worth reading.
